Generate or modify a React component with Tailwind CSS styling for the NexusHub project.

## Instructions

The component should follow these project conventions:
- Use the dark theme: `bg-gray-900` page background, `bg-gray-800` card backgrounds, `blue-500`/`blue-600` accent colors, `text-white`/`text-gray-300` text
- Follow existing patterns in `client/src/components/` (functional components, hooks)
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes (no custom CSS)
- Include responsive design (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints)
- Handle loading and error states where appropriate
